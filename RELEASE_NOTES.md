Release Notes
=============

v1.0.0-alpha.X
--------------

### Breaking changes

- Split `Specification` class into `SpecificationBase` and `TraitsData`
  This properly defines the separation of the generic data container
  from the strongly typed views used to get/set well known traits and
  their properties.
